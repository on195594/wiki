# Metcalfe's Law

The value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of users.

## Takeaways

- If you double the number of users, the potential connections roughly quadruple.
- This law highlights the importance of network effects: each new user adds value to existing users by creating new opportunities for interaction. A product or platform becomes exponentially more useful as its user base grows.
- This law helps explain why social media and messaging platforms can grow explosively in value once a tipping point is reached.

## Overview

Metcalfe’s Law is an observation about communications networks that has been generalized to many technology ecosystems. It says that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users. With 5 nodes, up to 10 pairwise connections are possible; with 12 nodes, 66.

Network effects feed on themselves, a rich-get-richer phenomenon. Initially, adding one user might not change much. But later, adding the 10-millionth user potentially enables millions of new interactions. This creates winner-takes-all dynamics in tech. However, Metcalfe’s Law is a simplified model, as not every user connects with every other, and incremental value can diminish.

## Examples

In social media, early Facebook had low utility if only a few friends were members. But as everyone you know joined, it became hugely valuable. The same holds for WhatsApp or WeChat: each new user can open chats with many others.

Metcalfe’s Law can also work in reverse. If users start leaving a social network, the value drops faster than linearly. Each departure reduces the potential connections for all who remain, creating a “death spiral” where declining value accelerates further departures.

## Origins

Metcalfe’s Law is named after Robert Metcalfe, who proposed the concept around 1980 while discussing Ethernet and network adoption. In 1983, he presented the idea to 3Com, arguing that network value grows as the square of compatible communicating devices.

The term “Metcalfe’s Law” was popularized in a 1993 Forbes magazine article by George Gilder, who used Metcalfe’s diagram to explain the rise of the Internet.

## Sarnoff, Metcalfe, and Reed's Laws

**Sarnoff’s Law** models broadcast networks, where value scales linearly with audience size (V ∝ n). **Reed’s Law** models group-forming networks, where potential value scales exponentially since possible subgroups grow as 2ⁿ. Slack, Discord, and collaborative tools fit Reed once group creation is central to the platform.
