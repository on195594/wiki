**Learn the applied-LLM stack the way you'll actually be interviewed on it:
framework-free, on a free API, from prompting all the way to serving, fine-tuning,
and a red-team benchmark.**

Runnable Colab notebooks for the **AI Engineer / Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE)**
skill set. You build working systems on top of foundation models (model APIs, RAG,
evals, agents, adaptation, serving) using raw APIs, not frameworks.

### What makes this different

- **Framework-free, on purpose.** You write the agent loop, RAG, and evals from
  raw API calls first, so you understand what LangChain/LlamaIndex actually do
  before you reach for them (and can judge when *not* to). Patterns are durable;
  wrappers churn.
- **Evals are the spine.** "Measure before you tune" is installed early and
  returns in every section. It's the habit that separates an engineer who shipped
  a system from one who built a demo.
- **Free to run, end to end.** Everything runs on the **free
  [Groq](https://console.groq.com/) API** (no credit card). The two topics Groq
  can't host, LoRA fine-tuning (06) and self-hosted serving (09), are
  concept-first with optional, fenced Colab-GPU appendices that were **verified on
  a real Colab T4**.
- **Real case studies, not toy demos.** Three end-to-end
  [case studies](https://github.com/calmrocks/ai-engineer-notebooks/tree/50bbea81c369a22242e901f90b5848078842c34d/12-case-studies-and-capstone/) show the skills combined under
  real constraints: a support assistant *debugged in production*, a
  pipeline-vs-agent cost showdown, and a red-team robustness benchmark.
- **OpenAI-compatible throughout**, so every pattern transfers directly to OpenAI
  and (with small changes) Anthropic. Swap the base URL and the skills carry over.

Built as the hands-on companion to
[Plan: Transitioning to Forward Deployed Engineer / AI Engineer](https://www.calm.rocks/resources/career-development/transition-fde-ai-engineer/).
The plan explains what to learn and why; these notebooks are where you run it.

## Who this is for

Backend or full-stack engineers moving into AI Engineer, FDE, Applied AI,
or Solutions Engineer (AI) roles. Different titles, largely the same job.
You can ship production code; you want the applied-model layer on top.

## Learning order

Work top to bottom. Each notebook is self-contained (installs its own
dependencies, reads API keys from Colab secrets) and ends with exercises.

### 09 — Serving & inference performance

Where the free Groq API can't run the topic (these frameworks need a GPU),
the notebook teaches it **concept-first** and fences an optional Colab-GPU
appendix, the same pattern as the section-06 LoRA appendix.

| Notebook | What you'll learn |
|---|---|
| [Serving frameworks](https://github.com/calmrocks/ai-engineer-notebooks/blob/50bbea81c369a22242e901f90b5848078842c34d/09-serving-inference/01-serving-frameworks.ipynb)<br>[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/calmrocks/ai-engineer-notebooks/blob/main/09-serving-inference/01-serving-frameworks.ipynb) | The serving stack an AI engineer actually picks between (vLLM, TGI, Triton, TensorRT-LLM): what each optimizes, how they map onto the raw API you've been calling, and when to reach for which |

|---|---|
| [Designing an inference service](https://github.com/calmrocks/ai-engineer-notebooks/blob/50bbea81c369a22242e901f90b5848078842c34d/10-ml-system-design/01-designing-an-inference-service.ipynb)<br>[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/calmrocks/ai-engineer-notebooks/blob/main/10-ml-system-design/01-designing-an-inference-service.ipynb) | Concept: the ML system design interview, worked end to end: QPS/VRAM/latency/cost estimation, replica scaling, queueing, caching, and the SLA trade-offs, on a realistic LLM-serving prompt |

| Notebook | What you'll learn |
|---|---|
| [Scoping & discovery](https://github.com/calmrocks/ai-engineer-notebooks/blob/50bbea81c369a22242e901f90b5848078842c34d/11-customer-craft/01-scoping-and-discovery.ipynb)<br>[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/calmrocks/ai-engineer-notebooks/blob/main/11-customer-craft/01-scoping-and-discovery.ipynb) | Turn a vague customer ask into a scoped, evaluable system: discovery questions, a one-page scoping doc, the demo discipline: the customer-scenario interview round most engineers can't evidence |

### 12 — Case Studies & Capstone

Where the skills come together into projects. First a **case study** (one
realistic scenario worked end to end, runnable), then the **capstone**: the
deployed repo you build yourself. ([Section overview](https://github.com/calmrocks/ai-engineer-notebooks/blob/50bbea81c369a22242e901f90b5848078842c34d/12-case-studies-and-capstone/README.md).)

| Notebook | What you'll learn |
|---|---|
| [Case study A — Customer-support assistant](https://github.com/calmrocks/ai-engineer-notebooks/blob/50bbea81c369a22242e901f90b5848078842c34d/12-case-studies-and-capstone/01-customer-support-assistant.ipynb)<br>[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/calmrocks/ai-engineer-notebooks/blob/main/12-case-studies-and-capstone/01-customer-support-assistant.ipynb) | One scenario scoped → built → served → **debugged in production**: a vague ask becomes a deployed, evaluated RAG+agent assistant, then a live quality regression (a stale index after a corpus migration) that you diagnose and fix. A build-to-debug arc threading sections 02–11 |
| [Case study B — Contract extraction: pipeline vs agent](https://github.com/calmrocks/ai-engineer-notebooks/blob/50bbea81c369a22242e901f90b5848078842c34d/12-case-studies-and-capstone/02-contract-extraction-pipeline-vs-agent.ipynb)<br>[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/calmrocks/ai-engineer-notebooks/blob/main/12-case-studies-and-capstone/02-contract-extraction-pipeline-vs-agent.ipynb) | The judgment call interviewers love: build the *same* extraction task as both an agent and a pipeline, then prove with accuracy + token cost that the pipeline wins when the steps are known |
| [Case study C — Red-team robustness benchmark](https://github.com/calmrocks/ai-engineer-notebooks/blob/50bbea81c369a22242e901f90b5848078842c34d/12-case-studies-and-capstone/03-red-team-robustness-benchmark.ipynb)<br>[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/calmrocks/ai-engineer-notebooks/blob/main/12-case-studies-and-capstone/03-red-team-robustness-benchmark.ipynb) | A different *kind* of system, a harness that evaluates a model instead of serving one: an attacker→target→judge (PAIR) loop that measures attack success rate, composing the agent loop, LLM-judge, security, and evals |

**Capstone:** [the brief](https://github.com/calmrocks/ai-engineer-notebooks/blob/50bbea81c369a22242e901f90b5848078842c34d/12-case-studies-and-capstone/CAPSTONE.md) for the deployed
project that goes on your resume, a real repo with a serving component and an
eval report. Case studies are for learning; the capstone is for hiring.

## Conventions

- **Raw model APIs, no frameworks.** Patterns are durable; wrappers churn.
- **One shared corpus** (`data/`) across RAG and eval sections, so evals
  measure the retrieval you actually built.
- **Self-contained notebooks.** First cell installs, second cell calls
  `from aien import setup; client, MODEL = setup()` to load your key from
  Colab secrets (or a local env var). No hidden state between notebooks.
  `aien` is the tiny shared-setup package in this repo (one place to change
  credential loading), installed automatically by the first cell.
- **Every notebook ends with exercises.** Do them before moving on.

## Setup

1. Get a free API key at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com/), no
   credit card required.
2. In Colab: the key icon in the left sidebar → add `GROQ_API_KEY` as a secret,
   and toggle notebook access on.
3. Open any notebook via its badge and run top to bottom.

Running locally instead: `pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e .`
(the second installs the `aien` setup helper), `export GROQ_API_KEY=...`,
open with Jupyter.
